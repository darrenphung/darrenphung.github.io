                        As interaction designers, out main task is to map out interactions that will be required 
                        to assist people in interacting with autonomous vehicles in future cities. We are required 
                        to follow a user-centered design process focusing on interface and interface animation design. 
                        With autonomous vehicles becoming more prevalent, as a designer we need to start thinking how 
                        people in the future will interact with autonomous vehicles.

                        As the brief is incredibly broad, we need to pin-point and identify a problem to look at where 
                        autonomous vehicles could be a part of the solution. We started with discussion and brainstorming, 
                        ultimately leading to utilizing the brainstorming Brain-Dumping. Brain-Dumping involves writing down 
                        any autonomous vehicle ideas possible. These ideas can be logical but also extremely ridiculous such 
                        as an autonomous vehicle to possibly brush your teeth. 
                        <br><br>
                        After much deliberation, we finalised on the 
                        decision to focus on human interaction between autonomous cars and parking.

                        A series of interviews were taken by drivers of all kind from drivers working full-time and driving to 
                        their workplace, driving to closer public transport or driving for leisure. Questions were varied to gauge 
                        how they used their cars on a weekly basis. Additional questions were asked concerning opinions of autonomous 
                        vehicles and their relationship with autonomous parking.

                        driving habits. Surveys were used to supplement the interviews in recognizing trends among drivers.

                        parking.

                        drop-off destination, it will queue the user to select parking preferences depending on Price, Time 
                        and Geography.

                        But in order to move forward and improve on our wireframes, we have to conduct a round of user testing.
                        <br><br>
                        The first of our Evaluation Methods was <b>Think-aloud User Testing</b>. For each of our <br>low-fidelity paper 
                        prototypes, we each came up with one scenario and had one task that encompasses the entire process. 
                        We noted any problems or issues encountered during the think-aloud, and post experience, we asked the 
                        user for feedback and recommendations. Key problems identified during this study will be further evaluated 
                        by the team through <b>Heuristic Evaluation</b>.

                    <p>
                        Our next user evaluation method was <b>First Click Testing</b>, this involved observing our user’s interactions 
                        with our wireframe. First click testing allows us to evaluate and understand the effectiveness and 
                        functionality of our wireframes, also giving us insights about how users differently approach their 
                        given tasks.

                        After user testing our wireframes and noting down appropriate changes it was time to create high-fidelity 
                        mock-ups representing the final concept. The mock-ups were created in Figma and Sketch while using google 
                        material design stylesheets to ensure our app had a consistent and professional feel. We decided to use green 
                        as a primary colour and using monotone colours such as grey, white and black to accent the green.

                        At this point we conducted another session of user testing by importing our high-fidelity into a quick and 
                        easy prototyping tool called InVision. The prototype was loaded onto a phone and were given to the same users 
                        we tested our mid-fidelity prototypes with as well as participants around the area. We created tasks for the 
                        users to perform and their speed and body language is taken note. For example, we asked the users to select 
                        a parking spot and park for 3 hours, ultimately having 5 of our participants to successfully perform the 
                        task and 3 participants needing assistance.

                        Based on the feedback received in out testing we noted down some concerns our participants voiced and focused 
                        on the pain points that overlapped between each participant. We updated the suitable screens to fix issues such 
                        as visibility, flow and amount of information. The primary concerns were the aesthetical factors but due to the 
                        lack of animation this factor was overlooked. Additionally, another concern for the app was the lack of clarity 
                        of when the car would be arriving to the pick-up location and the difficulty of cancelling certain actions 
                        indicating we need to consider error prevention methods.

                        ParkOff! Has a number of UI animations that support its concept and presents a professional and aesthetically 
                        pleasing user experience. Animations were done on Atomic.io, an open-source web-based program that run on google 
                        chrome and perfect for collaboration. Working with Atomic.io was extremely easy as there was no coding used and 
                        just a simple click and assigning preset transitions included in Atomic.io.
                        <br><br>
                        During the build, factors like speed of transitions and moving components were constantly altered to make the 
                        animation as close as possible to material design motion guidelines. Atomic.io allows for the build to be 
                        imported into a phone to simulate its appropriate environment.
